# BookNow

This is a project from my Code Academy course! I created endpoints in React that connect to the back-end API, giving CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality to the book club’s app. I implemented the following features:

Retreive the inital books list.
Add a book and its reading schedule to the list of books.
Update a book’s title and/or reading schedule.
Delete a book from the list of books.
