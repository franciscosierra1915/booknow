# BookNow

###### This is a project from my Code Academy course!

I created endpoints in React that connect to the back-end API, giving CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality to the book club’s app. I implemented the following features:

1. Retreive the inital books list.
2. Add a book and its reading schedule to the list of books.
3. Update a book’s title and/or reading schedule.
4. Delete a book from the list of books.
